# About Me


## Programming Experience  

#### C
> I have written a number of programs in C and will continue adding older programs to the ***Past Projects*** page as I complete new ones.
>
> C was the first language I learned but as I begin to learn new languages I find myself spending less and less time writing in C.  

#### Python
> Python has been my biggest Covid-19 project, and I have been teaching myself all summer. 
>
> I still have a ways to go but I am becoming more comfortable.

#### Markdown
> Markdown is probably the easiest language I've undertaken since I started programming, which makes it enjoyable to write.
>
> This entire project was written in Markdown.


## Hobbies and Interests
In addition to programming I enjoy a number of other hobbies. I try to always stay busy so I'm constantly trying new things.
* I spend a lot of time outdoors and love bass fishing.
* Lately my roommates and I have been playing a lot of the old Mario Kart Wii as well as Wii Sports Resort.
* I also enjoy listening to music and have something playing nearly every waking minute of my day.
